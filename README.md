PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Manual flight booking involves numerous steps such as searching for flights, entering passenger details etc.Each of these steps requires manual intervention, which can be time-consuming, especially during peak booking periods or when handling multiple bookings simultaneously.

Human errors, such as mistyped names, incorrect dates, or selecting the wrong flight or seat, are common in manual booking processes.

Manual booking processes have limited scalability, making it challenging to handle a high volume of bookings efficiently.

As the demand for travel services grows, manual processes may struggle to keep up and  can lead to booking inaccuracies, flight delays, customer dissatisfaction, and additional costs for corrections.
